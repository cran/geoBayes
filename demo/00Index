yield2         Transformed Gaussian spatial model: Estimate the impact of the
  rhizoctonia disease on yield using full Bayesian analysis.

yield3         Transformed Gaussian spatial model: Estimate the impact of the
  rhizoctonia disease on yield using empirical Bayes methods. Does not
  estimate the link function.

yield4         Transformed Gaussian spatial model: Estimate the impact of the
  rhizoctonia disease on yield using empirical Bayes methods. Also estimates
  the link function. This example can be time-consuming.

rhizoctonia1   Binomial SGLMM: Analysis of the rhizoctonia data using full
  Bayesian analysis.

rhizoctonia3   Binomial SGLMM: Analysis of the rhizoctonia
  data using empirical Bayes methods. Uses the function ebsglmm.

rhizoctonia2   Binomial SGLMM: Analysis of the rhizoctonia
  data using empirical Bayes methods. Uses the functions mcsglmm, bf1skel,
  bf2new, bf2optim.
