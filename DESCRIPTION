Title: Analysis of Geostatistical Data using Bayes and Empirical Bayes
        Methods
Description: Functions to fit geostatistical data. The data can be
        continuous, binary or count data and the models implemented are
        flexible. Conjugate priors are assumed on some parameters while
        inference on the other parameters can be done through a full
        Bayesian analysis of by empirical Bayes methods.
